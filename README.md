# 🧠 Anonymous Artifacts

This repository contains the materials used and produced during the article "AI-Generated User Stories: Are They Good Enough?", which investigates the automated generation of user stories using Large Language Models (LLMs), with a focus on advanced prompting techniques such as *Meta Prompting* and *Few-Shot Learning*.

## 📁 File Descriptions

### 📊 Analysis of Modifications.xlsx
Contains the analysis of improvements made by each group to the user stories. The spreadsheet compares the versions generated using the standard US-Prompt with those produced after specific modifications made by each group, highlighting the impact of the changes on story quality.

### 📊 Evaluation of User Story.xlsx
Includes the quality evaluation of user stories generated by participants based on the *Quality User Story (QUS)* framework. Each story was analyzed according to criteria such as atomicity, completeness, and estimability.

### 📄 Framework Quality User Story
An explanatory document presenting the seven criteria of the *QUS* framework (Lucassen et al., 2016). It serves as the basis for assessing story quality, ensuring that they are well-defined, specific, understandable, and useful for agile development.

### 📄 TAM Questionnaire
A questionnaire based on the *Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)*, applied to assess participants' acceptance of the automated approach. It measures perceived usefulness, ease of use, and behavioral intention to use the technology.

### 📄 US-Prompt for User Story
A document containing the Standard US-Prompts used for the automated generation of user stories. It includes all activities and instructions to guide the production of high-quality stories.

## 📌 QUS Framework

User stories were evaluated based on the following QUS criteria:

1. *Well-Formed*: Includes role, action, and clear purpose.  
2. *Atomic*: Covers a single specific functionality.  
3. *Minimal*: Does not include unnecessary information.  
4. *Conceptually Sound*: The action represents a functionality and the purpose justifies it.  
5. *Unambiguous*: Avoids terms or abstractions that may lead to multiple interpretations.  
6. *Complete Sentence*: Grammatically and structurally sound, providing sufficient context.  
7. *Estimable*: Specific enough to be planned and prioritized.
